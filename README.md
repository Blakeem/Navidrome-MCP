### Prerequisites

* **Node.js 20+** ([Download here](https://nodejs.org/))
* **Running Navidrome server** with your music library
* **Claude Desktop** or **ChatGPT Desktop** (or any MCP-compatible client)

**Additional for manual build:**
* **pnpm** package manager ([Install instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation))

### Quick Setup

#### Method 1: NPM Package (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using the published npm package, which auto-updates on launch:

```bash
npm install -g navidrome-mcp
```

üì¶ **Package**: [navidrome-mcp on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/navidrome-mcp)

This installs the MCP server globally and keeps it up-to-date automatically.

#### Method 2: Manual Build (Development)

For development or custom builds:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blakeem/Navidrome-MCP.git
cd navidrome-mcp
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

### Configure Claude Desktop

Find your configuration file:
* **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
* **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
* **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the Navidrome MCP server:

#### Using NPM Package (Recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "navidrome": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["navidrome-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "NAVIDROME_URL": "http://your-server:4533",
        "NAVIDROME_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "NAVIDROME_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "NAVIDROME_DEFAULT_LIBRARIES": "1,2", // Optional: Set default active libraries (comma-separated IDs)
        "LASTFM_API_KEY": "your_api_key", // Get your own at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
        "RADIO_BROWSER_USER_AGENT": "Navidrome-MCP/1.0 (+https://github.com/Blakeem/Navidrome-MCP)",
        "LYRICS_PROVIDER": "lrclib",
        "LRCLIB_USER_AGENT": "Navidrome-MCP/1.0 (+https://github.com/Blakeem/Navidrome-MCP)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Using Manual Build (Alternative)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "navidrome": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/navidrome-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "NAVIDROME_URL": "http://your-server:4533",
        "NAVIDROME_USERNAME": "your_username",
        "NAVIDROME_PASSWORD": "your_password",
        "NAVIDROME_DEFAULT_LIBRARIES": "1,2", // Optional: Set default active libraries (comma-separated IDs)
        "LASTFM_API_KEY": "your_api_key", // Get your own at https://www.last.fm/api/account/create
        "RADIO_BROWSER_USER_AGENT": "Navidrome-MCP/1.0 (+https://github.com/Blakeem/Navidrome-MCP)",
        "LYRICS_PROVIDER": "lrclib",
        "LRCLIB_USER_AGENT": "Navidrome-MCP/1.0 (+https://github.com/Blakeem/Navidrome-MCP)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**:
- **NPM method**: Uses `npx navidrome-mcp` which auto-updates on each launch
- **Manual method**: Requires absolute paths (full path from root) and manual updates
- **Library filtering**: Use `NAVIDROME_DEFAULT_LIBRARIES` to set default active libraries (e.g., "1" for one library, "1,2,3" for multiple)
  - If not set, all libraries are active by default
  - You can change active libraries at runtime using the `set_active_libraries` tool
  - Invalid library IDs are ignored with a warning
- Get a free Last.fm API key at [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/api) (optional - enables music discovery)
- Radio Browser integration requires a User-Agent string (enables station discovery)
- Lyrics integration works without API keys (LRCLIB is free)
- Features are automatically enabled/disabled based on available configuration
- Restart Claude Desktop after saving

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Problems**
- Verify Navidrome server is running
- Check URL includes protocol (http:// or https://)
- Ensure credentials are correct
- Test with `curl` or browser first

**macOS Specific**
- See [macOS Troubleshooting Guide](docs/MACOS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Common issue: Node.js path not found
- Solution: Create symlinks or use full paths

**Configuration Issues**
- Use absolute paths in config files
- Validate JSON syntax (no trailing commas)
- Check environment variables are set
- Restart client after changes

### Limitations

**Playback Control**: This MCP server manages your library and queues but doesn't directly control playback. Use your Navidrome client app for play/pause/skip.

**Recently Played**: Navidrome doesn't provide last-played timestamps, only play counts and completion status.

**Queue Management**: Works with Subsonic-compatible clients that support jukebox mode.
