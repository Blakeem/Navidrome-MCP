## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Connection Problems**
- Verify Navidrome server is running
- Check URL includes protocol (http:// or https://)
- Ensure credentials are correct
- Test with `curl` or browser first

**macOS Specific**
- See [macOS Troubleshooting Guide](docs/MACOS_TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
- Common issue: Node.js path not found
- Solution: Create symlinks or use full paths

**Configuration Issues**
- Use absolute paths in config files
- Validate JSON syntax (no trailing commas)
- Check environment variables are set
- Restart client after changes

### Limitations

**Playback Control**: This MCP server manages your library and queues but doesn't directly control playback. Use your Navidrome client app for play/pause/skip.

**Recently Played**: Navidrome doesn't provide last-played timestamps, only play counts and completion status.

**Queue Management**: Works with Subsonic-compatible clients that support jukebox mode.
